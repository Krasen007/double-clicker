OK, so your interested in helping this project but not quite sure in what way you can help or how to go about it practically, or how to get involved.

How you can help depends on what skills and experience you already have, and what skills and experience you want to gain through this project.
**If you are not a software programmer you can still help.**

Read this to find out how you'd like to help, then goto **Get in touch** at the bottom of this page.

### Google Code ###
This project (as you can see!) is hosted on Google Code servers.
There are two main ways to interact with the Google Code version control system:
  * This **web user interface** to the system. From here you can:
    * read, edit and add to the wiki based documentation
    * browse source code, and request and provide code reviews
    * submit and update Issues (errors/bugs/etc)
    * download any file that has been specifically set-up for users in the [Downloads](Downloads.md) section
  * Use "subversion" to add/modify wiki documentation or source files off-line.

#### Subversion - version control system ####
[subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) (also called svn) is a set of version control tools that you use on your computer (most Operating Systems are supported) to modify contents of the project. The wiki can also be modified off-line using subversion.

With subversion you 'check out' copies of the entire project or specific files (source code, html, wiki pages) then run, test, modify them on your computer and then check them back into the central server version where others can see them and they can be integrated into the project.

## Area: Documentation ##
Add to this wiki documentation of the project, or create developer and end user documentation.

To edit wiki entries you'll need to learn a little [wiki markup](http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WikiSyntax), but it's pretty simple and with a few commands you're off and running.

## Area: Software development ##
There are a number of sub-areas in the software that require different knowledge:
  * General software skills on (currently) Windows.
  * We'd be interested to hear of people wanting to port to Mac OS X or Linux.

The code is written in 'C++' using MS Visual Studio. We plan to make sure it's compatible with the free version of MSV Studio called "Express" and maybe other free IDEs in the future.

Areas of work for software developers include:
  * Adding a UI to select the key desired to use for each event
  * Porting to other OS
  * Possibly in the future add some more functionality to help (such as mouse pointer movement filtering to remove shake....who knows!)

## Area: Testing ##
Help us make sure it installs and runs on many configurations and versions of Windows. Help detect possible key conflicts with other applications.
