Utility to help people who have trouble with double-click mouse actions

double-clicker is a project from the non-profit Autelic Association (http://www.autelic.org). Read Background for more info on Autelic.

The project goal is to help people who for one reason or another have difficulty performing a double-click action with a mouse, or performing it without moving the on-screen pointer during the double-click - which can have some unintended side effects.

It is a small utility that allows an unused key on the keyboard to be used to produce the double-click (and single-click) mouse event, separating pointing (via mouse or other) from activating or selecting (clicking). The mouse maybe moved with one-hand and "double-clicks" produced with the other hand on the keyboard, or the same hand can be used for both.

Initially it is available for Windows, but we'd welcome volunteers to help produce simple to install and use, polished implementations for Mac OS X and Linux

If you are interested in helping develop it, by writing some code, porting to a new platform, designing icons, or writing some documentation then visit our volunteer page
