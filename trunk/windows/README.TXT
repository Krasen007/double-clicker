README.TXT

==========


All documentation on double-clicker can be found at the Google Code project "double-clicker"
whose home page is: http://code.google.com/p/double-clicker/



The wiki documentation list is at http://code.google.com/p/double-clicker/wiki/



However, we document a few other things here as this might be the first place you look 
after downloading the source, and trying to make and run it, if you come across problems.



NOTE that the latest version will probably also be the wiki though!
