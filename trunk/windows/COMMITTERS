The following people have commit access to the double-clicker sources which are hosted 
in the "double-clicker" Google Code project at http://code.google.com/p/double-clicker



Other people may have contributed to the project via patches submitted, and committed 
by someone on this list. Those other contributors should be recognized in the commit log 
for the relevant change, hence the log is the final source of all information on who was 
the source of a contribution.



If you have a question or comment, it's probably best to mail info@autelic.org, 
rather 
than mailing any of these people directly.
